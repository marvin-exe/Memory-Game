# Memory Game
A personal take on the traditional memory game also known as Concentration.

## How to play
- Click on one card to flip it  
- Click on a second card to see if it matches the first one  
- If they match they will remain flipped  
- If they don't match, they will return to their original position

The point of the game is to match all cards on the deck. You win the game when all cards are matched.
